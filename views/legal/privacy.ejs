                    this

                    litigation in which we are involved.
                    More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the
                    following
                    situations:</p>

                <p>Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third party
                    vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and
                    require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data
                    analysis,

                    third
                    parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how
                    you
                    interact with the Services over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze
                    and
                    track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.
                    Unless
                    described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third
                    parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

                <p>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
                    negotiations
                    of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
                    business to
                    another company.</p>

                <p>Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the
                    Services. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites
                    that are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements
                    about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

                    other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such
                    personal
                    information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed outside the Services in
                    perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate
                    with
                    you within our Services, and view your profile.</p>



                <h3>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>

                <p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
                </p>

                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
                    information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain
                    cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.</p>



                <h3>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

                <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                    privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
                    in
                    this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                    accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your
                    personal
                    information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                    delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                    has
                    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
                    it
                    from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


                <h3>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

                <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
                    technical
                    security measures.</p>

                <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
                    the
                    security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
                    guarantee
                    that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                    information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
                    should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>



                <h3>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

                <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the
                    Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
                    minor
                    and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
                    from
                    users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
                    reasonable
                    measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have
                    collected from children under age 18, please contact us at thecerealcoder@gmail.com.</p>

                    authority. You can find their contact details here:

                <h5>Account Information</h5>

                <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
                    account, you can:</p>

                <p>Log into your account settings and update your user account.</p>

                <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
                    information
                    from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud,
                    troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with
                    legal
                    requirements.</p>

                <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
                    prefer,
                    you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to
                    remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To
                    opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit
                    http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>

                    clicking
                    on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided
                    below.
                    You will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we will still need to send you
                    service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account. To
                    otherwise
                    opt-out, you may:</p>


                <h3>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing
                    and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                    signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                    If
                    a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                    about
                    that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>

                    to

                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who
